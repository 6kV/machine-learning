# Machine Learning

This is a collection of notes and code for machine learning algorithms.

Most of these will be Matlab/Octave files. Would like to add some Python/Numpy implementations later.



## Linear regression

Regularized linear regression has the following cost function:

Correspondingly, the partial derivative of regularized linear regression's cost for Î¸j is defined as:
